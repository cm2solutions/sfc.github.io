# Belkirk College of Engineering Website

This is a Jekyll-based website for Belkirk College of Engineering, a fictional engineering college. It is likely a demo for Forestry.io.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

## Project Structure

The website appears to be a static HTML/CSS/JS website. The directory structure is as follows:

* `css/`: Contains stylesheets for the website.
* `js/`: Contains JavaScript files for website interactivity.
* `img/`: Contains static images used in the site's design, such as logos and favicons.
* `uploads/`: Likely contains user-uploaded images and media, possibly managed via a CMS like Forestry.
* `posts/`: Contains blog post-like content. While not dynamically generated by Jekyll in a typical setup, it uses a similar structure with yearly/monthly/daily subdirectories for individual posts.
* `projects/`: Contains pages for different projects showcased by the college.
* `about/`: Contains the main "About Us" page and potentially individual pages for staff members.
* `contact/`: Contains the contact page.
* `webfonts/`: Contains web font files used for custom typography.
* `.forestryio/`: This directory indicates that the site is managed using the Forestry.io CMS.

It's worth noting the absence of typical Jekyll directories like `_layouts`, `_includes`, or a `_config.yml` file. This suggests that while some path names or comments in files might hint at Jekyll, the site is not currently set up as a standard Jekyll build.

## Running the Project Locally

As this is a static HTML/CSS/JS website, no special build process is required to view it locally. You can serve the files using a simple local HTTP server.

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and change to the directory where you cloned or downloaded this project.

2.  **Start a local HTTP server:**
    You can use Python's built-in HTTP server or `npx http-server` if you have Node.js installed.

    *   **Using Python 3:**
        ```bash
        python -m http.server
        ```
        By default, this usually serves the site on port 8000.

    *   **Using Node.js/npx (if you have `http-server` installed or want to run it without global installation):**
        ```bash
        npx http-server
        ```
        This will also typically serve the site on port 8080 or 8000 and will print the address in the terminal.

3.  **Open in your browser:**
    Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the address shown in your terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).
